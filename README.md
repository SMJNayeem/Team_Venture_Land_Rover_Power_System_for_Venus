## Project Scope:

Desiging Energy Stroge System For Venus Surface Mission

## Story Telling:

Suppose you wanna operate a mission somewhere where the temperature and pressure are too high to make the microcomputer functionable, it is impossible to produce sufficient heat to power up your vehicle. What should you do then? That is the question we, the team venture, are trying to solve. Designing a powerful energy storage system for your next mission.

## Project Description Overview:

![System Workflow](/assets/images/Workflow.png)

We conceptualize an energy storage system for the next NASA mission to venus. To explore Venus for at least 60 days, we proposed an energy producer, storage and cooling system to power up the rover. We designed a system with no recharge time containing an mmRTG power system generating electricity. A sodium sulfur battery for storing electricity and supplying it to rover. A stirling cooling system to maintain the operating temperature of semiconductors.

## Project Discussion:

Designing a energy storage system for Venus mission is difficult. Because, the extreme atmospheric condition of Venus. That’s why we proposed a Radio-isotop Thermoelectric Generator(RTG) for our power souce where plutonium-238 will be used for production. Then we have to store the energy. For storing, we will use NaS battery.

As Venus is very hot planet and it’s temperature is ~460 C. Also the MMRTG will generate approximately 1020 C, so the temperature will be so high that need to be reduce. Then we need a cooler. And, that’s why we proposed to use Stiring Cooler system which pump the heat out of the rover. The Stirling cooler transfers the waste heat to convective radiators, which efficiently reject heat to the Venus atmosphere at a temperature of 500 °C, 40 °C above the surface ambient temperature.

### MMRTG

We have designed a system that can power up the land rover with a radio-isotope thermo-electric generator (RTG), a sodium sulfur battery to provide any shortage of power, and a cooling system in the rover. To drive a rover we need a power source that can generate or provide at least 215 watts per hour. The RTG will provide power to the rover constantly. We proposed to use Plutonium-238 as the radio-isotope material which can provide a 0.54 watts per gram energy, at 10% efficiency it will generate 0.054 watts per gram. We have calculated 4 kg of plutonium for our system to provide 215 watts per hour energy and has an operational lifetime of at least 14 years.

RTG was used during the appolo program to moon, in voyager 1 and 2, in Cassini to saturn, in Curiosity, in Perseverance to mars and not a single thermocouple has failed. The plutonium 238 is an alpha emitter. Alpha particles can be very easily shielded. Even a sheet of paper is enough to protect us against alpha radiation. Its only a hazard to the human body if its inhaled or is its ingested. To prevent that we use the fuel in an oxide form as plutonium 238 dioxide. Surrounding the plutonium fuel is a material called Iridium. Iridium at these operating temperatures is very strong and very ductile. Iridium also has a very high melting point and it has a good material compatibility with the other materials found in the GPHS module. Over the last 40 years an aggressive testing campaign is engaged to prove the safety of these devices. every time they behave exactly as they were designed.

### Battery

Sodium sulfur batteries can operate at 450 degree celsius. our batteries are sized to provide 2200 Whr of energy storage and a specific energy of 220 Whr/kg (340 kWhr/m3) with an average power draw of 64.5 W.The purpose of this cooling system is to allow the electronics to be used in their functional temperature.

The system allows a high-temperature silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microcontroller to be used in 3000C with ambient heat load of 110 W. The mass of this system is 1.6 kg with an astounding mechanical efficiency of 85%.

### Cooling System

The cooling requirement to keep the heat pipe cold-side temperature at 475 K is 105 W of heat pumping. As calculated using the Stirling heat-engine design tool SAGE, the configuration that was modeled effectively pumps 100 W of heat across the required 300°C of temperature differential with an operating coefficient of performance of 0.44, requiring approximately 240 W of input power, which can be provided by an isotope power system.

## Space Agency Data:

## Hackathon Journey:

This is for the first time all of the member of our team perticipate on NASA Space App Challenge 2022 Bangladesh Chapter. Although we knew about space app challenge, but this is for the first time we perticipate and work on. We were selected as Top 50 Team from Bangladesh and got the opportunity to perticipate on 36 hours long Hackathon. We don't know our precise outcome. It was a wonderfull journey. We learn a lot from everywhere. Every second during the 36 hours Hackathon time, we learn lot from outside(Google, Internet), also learn so many concept, knowledge, problem solving technique and much more from our respected mentor who guided us from the very begening of Space App Challenge 2022.
