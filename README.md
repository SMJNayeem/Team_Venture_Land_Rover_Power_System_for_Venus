Hello and Welcome to Team Venture official GitHub Resources.

##Project Scope: Desiging Energy Stroge System For Venus Surface Mission

## Story Telling:

Suppose you wanna operate a mission somewhere where the temperature and pressure are too high to make the microcomputer functionable, it is impossible to produce sufficient heat to power up your vehicle. What should you do then? That is the question we, the team venture, are trying to solve. Designing a powerful energy storage system for your next mission.

## Project Description Overview:

We conceptualize an energy storage system for the next NASA mission to venus. To explore Venus for at least 60 days, we proposed an energy producer, storage and cooling system to power up the rover. We designed a system with no recharge time containing an mmRTG power system generating electricity. A sodium sulfur battery for storing electricity and supplying it to rover. A stirling cooling system to maintain the operating temperature of semiconductors.
