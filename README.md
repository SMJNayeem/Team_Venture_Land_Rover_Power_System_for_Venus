Hello and Welcome to Team Venture official GitHub Resources.

## Project Scope: Desiging Energy Stroge System For Venus Surface Mission

## Story Telling:

Suppose you wanna operate a mission somewhere where the temperature and pressure are too high to make the microcomputer functionable, it is impossible to produce sufficient heat to power up your vehicle. What should you do then? That is the question we, the team venture, are trying to solve. Designing a powerful energy storage system for your next mission.

## Project Description Overview:

We conceptualize an energy storage system for the next NASA mission to venus. To explore Venus for at least 60 days, we proposed an energy producer, storage and cooling system to power up the rover. We designed a system with no recharge time containing an mmRTG power system generating electricity. A sodium sulfur battery for storing electricity and supplying it to rover. A stirling cooling system to maintain the operating temperature of semiconductors.

## Project Discussion:

Designing a energy storage system for Venus mission is difficult. Because, the extreme atmospheric condition of Venus. That’s why we proposed a Radio-isotop Thermoelectric Generator(RTG) for our power souce where plutonium-238 will be used for production. Then we have to store the energy. For storing, we will use NaS battery.

As Venus is very hot planet and it’s temperature is ~460 C. Also the MMRTG will generate approximately 1020 C, so the temperature will be so high that need to be reduce. Then we need a cooler. And, that’s why we proposed to use Stiring Cooler system which pump the heat out of the rover. The Stirling cooler transfers the waste heat to convective radiators, which efficiently reject heat to the Venus atmosphere at a temperature of 500 °C, 40 °C above the surface ambient temperature.

The cooling requirement to keep the heat pipe cold-side temperature at 475 K is 105 W of heat pumping. As calculated using the Stirling heat-engine design tool SAGE, the configuration that was modeled effectively pumps 100 W of heat across the required 300°C of temperature differential with an operating coefficient of performance of 0.44, requiring approximately 240 W of input power, which can be provided by an isotope power system.
